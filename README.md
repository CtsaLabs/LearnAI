This is my  git  test repo from learning AI.# AI
Journeys in AI from zero to Hero.

This is my journey in AI. Coming from a traditional programming/software development background but caught the interest in Artificial Intelligence and its massive contributions to humnan and technology developments, i wanted to unnderstand and be a contributor to AI developments however i kept procastinating over the years without taking action. The new government launch of 3MTT-3 Million Technology Talent initiative in late year 2023 by Minister for Communnications and an acquaintance, offering a possibility to be tutored in my deep interest of AI, spurred me to register and that is where the whole journey began.  

I don't know how far the journey will take me but so far, it has been an interesting ride. Contained in this repository are learning codes, assignments, practice projects and the likes for future refeencing. 

Perhaps i could go Pro, if the opportunnity comes but for now this is a curiousity conquest adventure. Happy viewing.....Sat,March 23, 2024
